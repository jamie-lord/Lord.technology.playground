Having attended Dr Richard Stallman's interesting talk at Lincoln University yesterday, I thought I'd have a look on Twitter at reactions to his militant views. One tweet sent me to the [best software license](https://github.com/landondyer/kasm/blob/master/LICENSE) I've ever seen: ABRMS. landondyer has taken it upon themselves to write this short license, presumably they're not a fan of Stallman...
