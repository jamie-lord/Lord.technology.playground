Finding a source of inspiration for a new project can be tough, I think so at least. So when I stumbled upon [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com/) my mind was blown. This site hands out awards to the very best websites as chosen by an elite group of developers. The featured sites are all of incredible quality and are truly inspiring - they're normally very artistic and almost solely use CSS3 and HTML5 to produce epic effects.

Each site up for review is awarded a score for design, creativity, usability and content; all key ingredients for a great website. Every day the best site is given an award, most sites will proudly display this badge on their homepage - demonstrating how important getting an Awwward is. On another note, the [Awwwards Blog](http://www.awwwards.com/blog/) is a great resource for tips and updates about web development. Have a browse, I find myself frequently finding innovative implementations of stale techniques.
