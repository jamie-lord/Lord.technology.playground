Google seems to be in the habit of making helpful little websites packed with info for developers. An apparently new addition to their line-up is the [Device metrics](https://design.google.com/devices/) page. It includes a list of common devices with some key data such screen resolution, dimension and aspect ratio - all parameters are sortable too. Although this information can easily be found elsewhere, having commonly used data in one place and delivered in such a usable form is undoubtedly useful.
