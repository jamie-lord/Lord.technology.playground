I like Windows 10. As a developer using .Net and Azure I use Windows all the time and generally think it's pretty great. However out of the box it does contain some annoying default settings, features and apps that I'd personally like gone.

There are lots of existing PowerShell scripts to do this but I've recently stumbled upon a nice little app that helps explain what it's doing before it potentially wreaks havoc on your system. [Privatezilla](https://www.builtbybel.com/ms-apps/privatezilla) is Open Source and simply lists what it can do, allowing you to select many irritations to turn off like telemetry, Cortana, deafult apps and location tracking.
