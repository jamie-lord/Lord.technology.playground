This blog uses Jekyll and I've no plans to change that - Jekyll is a great static site generator with plenty of features and a high level of maturity. Once in a while though I like to freshen things up by changing the theme or editing the one I'm using.

Early in 2021 I started using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) theme. This post isn't to go through how great this theme is, but to point out the fantastic experience I had using it. The documentation for this theme is hands down the best I've ever seen for any software - whether a library or language, it is simply fantastic.

Without being too wordy, it covers every feature it supports and gives enough examples to allow quick progress when using it. The [configuration page](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration) is particularly useful. Although long, it goes through pretty much every setting the theme has, with concise explanations and examples. I systematically went through the entire page, modifying my configuration as I went to achieve the result I desired. This allowed me to discover the full capabilities of this theme (there are a lot) whilst wasting no time and with little-to-no frustration - a rare experience indeed.

Much like design, I appreciate that writing good documentation is a skill that should not be overlooked by developers. Having strong documentation, particularly with an open source project, is a powerful tool to give you the best possibility your project will be adopted as well as ensuring other developers have a good experience whilst trying to contribute. Minimal Mistakes was so trivial to set up and customise that I had no reason to look elsewhere, I can certainly see why it is one of the most popular Jekyll themes. If only this standard of documentation was common with software projects...
