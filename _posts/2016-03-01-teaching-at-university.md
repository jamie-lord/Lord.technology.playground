Whilst studying for my integrated master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Lincoln, I'm also demonstrating on a number of modules to enhance my own skills as well as gain some valuable teaching experience.

## Level 3 Mobile Computing

For semester A, Mobile Computing comprises of Android application design and development. The module assessment requires students to design and develop an app that utilises a third-party API as well as local storage or SQLite. Students are encouraged to include other advanced functionality in their projects.

As a demonstrator, I assist students during their workshop sessions in working on set workshop tasks in addition to their final assessment project. This demands a strong understanding of Android application development and Java; in addition to fast problem solving and typical teaching/tutoring skills.

## Level 1 Introduction to Social Computing

This first year module includes a basic introduction to social computing, with a focus on data science skills. [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) has been used by the students to gather, parse and analyse datasets from a variety of sources, culminating in a formal assignment.

## Level 2 Cloud Computing

This second year module offers Computer Information Systems students an overview of cloud computing practices and introduces them to Microsoft Azure. Creating deployment scripts, load balancing and high-availability are all ares covered in this module.

## Level 1 Computer Architectures

Computer Architectures is a mandatory first year module, meaning that nearly 300 students are enrolled for 2016. The module looks at the fundamental principles behind computer hardware as well as CPU architectures.
