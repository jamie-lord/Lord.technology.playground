I'd just started drafting a post about combining [HTMX](https://htmx.org) with Razor pages to produce dynamic web applications and thought I'd better quickly check the internets to ensure it hadn't been covered since I first started thinking about this over Christmas. [And of course it had!](https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/using-htmx-with-aspnet-core) So I won't bother doing a similar thing here, go and [read this developers posts instead](https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/using-htmx-with-aspnet-core). However I'm still going to look to play around with this combination of technologies as it looks like a really good idea and I'm quite surprised the .Net community hasn't covered this more - it's exactly the sort of thing I expect to see Scott Hanselman blogging about. Depending on how that post series pans out, I may look to adding more on the topic, for example I'm interested in what code patterns could be used to make the development experience as easy to work with as possible.
