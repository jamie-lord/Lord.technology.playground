Jekyll makes it trivial to edit a site's look and feel, just modify your sass files and push to Github. I keep playing around with colours, paddings and fonts - there's always something to tweak.

I recently stumbled on [_Marvin Visions_](https://www.readvisions.com/marvin) a bold and striking typeface - I liked it so much I've started using it for headings on this site[^1]. Coupled with an old favorite of mine, [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/), this font looks particularly good on little blog posts like this one.

[^1]: As you will certainly be reading this in the future, it is entirely possible that I'm no longer using this font on this site. However it's still worth checking out if you're looking for a classic sci-fi typeface that wouldn't look out of place on the cover of an Asimov novel.
