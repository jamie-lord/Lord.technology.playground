How can web forms be reformed into a 21st century tool for data input? [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/Development/MinimalForm/) have published an interesting take on the traditional form that improves usability at the expense of universal support.

> Today we'd like share a very simplistic form interface with you. You've probably seen this kind of single input view form in several modern websites. We spotted one in the end of the PageLanes website and thought that this is a really nice and user-friendly concept for a form.

> So, the idea is to show the user just one input field at a time, without any clutter or distractions, but only with elements that are helpful in indicating how much needs to be filled. On the PageLanes form this is done by adding the step information to the button that will show the next question. But we tried a slightly different layout, with a tiny progress bar and a number indicator on the right side below the input field. We also added some subtle effects when showing the next input.

> Please note that we are using some modern CSS properties like pointer-events and animations which are not supported in older browsers.
