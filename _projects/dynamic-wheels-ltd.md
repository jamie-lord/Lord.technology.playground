Dynamic Wheels Ltd. required a new responsive ecommerce website to provide detailed information to customers regarding their services as well as general advertisement of the brand.

The new website has been constructed using WordPress to allow easy management of content, including adding new pages, blog posts and products as well as editing existing content using a WYSIWYG editor.

The website is fully responsive, meaning it's fully functional on mobile devices and the largest of desktop monitors alike. The homepage features a large image slider detailing the most frequently used services as well as an FAQ section, providing fast and easy access to useful information for potential customers.

One feature of the new website that the client specifically required was an image gallery to showcase previous work and the process of completing it. This can be seen in the image above.

As mentioned, this website also has an online store, including a complete checkout and payment system that allows Dynamic Wheels to manage stock and orders within WordPress.

To ensure good performance, this website is hosted by myself as part of my platform - providing fantastic performance without the client having to manage their own server, something that can be time consuming and requires technical knowledge. Using Cloudflare also enhances the user experience, caching content, removing server load and providing a robust system that ensures scalability.
