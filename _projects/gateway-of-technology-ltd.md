Telecommunications and Internet service provider [Gateway of Technology Ltd.](http://www.gotltd.co.uk/) required a refresh of their homepage as well as extensive search engine optimisation.

The homepage design was simplified considerably, removing distracting gifs and confusion elements that didn't convey a message clearly. Below is the homepage before the redesign.

The new homepage uses the grid system from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to display a simple, easy to understand overview of the services offered by Gateway. A prominent quick-quote form is included beside an image slider showing some of the best deals and services available. Simplifying the colour scheme makes the homepage feel more professional and easier on the eyes.

Due to the simplified design as well as clean code, the homepage loads considerably faster than the old design, this aids SEO as well as simply improving the experience for users, particularly using mobile devices.

Extensive search engine optimisation was conducted on this site, including the integration of a new keyword management system as well as a complete analysis of the site's resources and content. By modifying everything from server settings to image, CSS and javascript optimisation, the website was completely revitalised.
