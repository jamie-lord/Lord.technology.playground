The University of Lincoln American Football team (The Lincoln Colonials) required new web hosting to allow them to migrate from an archaic Drupal site to a new WordPress one. Thanks to my highly flexible and expandable infrastructure I was able to deliver a superior hosting platform at a very reasonable cost.

The team's new website has been created by [Charles Osei]({{ site.url }}/projects/charles-oseis-blog) (himself a member of the team) using WordPress. The site resides on a Linux (Ubuntu) server that features Varnish Cache as well as [Cloudflare's](https://www.cloudflare.com/) epic CDN.

Thanks to the combination of these technologies the website is very fast, even though it contains a large amount of images and multimedia.
