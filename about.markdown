I'm Jamie Lord, a full stack Lead Software Engineer currently building multi-tenant SaaS applications using Azure technologies and C#.

Experienced in building development teams and instilling a culture that results in reliable, maintainable products where team members feel empowered to increase quality and take real ownership of their work - I live and breath software development and relish the challenges it poses.

## My current work sees me using

- C# .Net Core 3.1 and .Net 5.0
- Razor pages and MVC
- Vue.js & Vuex with TypeScript
- C# Web APIs (using Swagger and NSwag Studio)
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL
- Azure Service Bus
- Azure App Services
- Azure Functions
- SignalR
- Azure Front Door

It's pretty rare that I'm not toying with a side-project or two ([see GitHub for more](https://github.com/jamie-lord)) and I particularly enjoy using Blazor to rapidly prototype - something I've been doing since 0.1.0 back in March 2018.
